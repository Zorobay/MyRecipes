    steps:
    - Combine all ingredients except rich simple syrup in a sterilized, one-quart lidded glass jar. Shake to combine. Refrigerate 72 hours, shaking occasionally, at least once per day.
    - "Make rich simply syrup: dissolve 3 cups sugar in 1 ½ cups water over medium heat until sugar is completely dissolved. Allow to cool. Transfer to a container and refrigerate."
    - After 72 hours, strain tonic mixture into a large glass pitcher. Strain tonic a second time, using a coffee filter or very fine cheesecloth.
    - Whisk simple syrup into tonic until thoroughly combined.
    - Pour tonic syrup through a funnel into storage bottles and store in the refrigerator.
