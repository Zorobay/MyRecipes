title: Mezcal Sour
description: This tangy-sweet cocktail gets its lofty, fluffy froth from egg whites and a two-step mixing technique. The first shake, without ice, helps create the foam. After adding ice, the second shake chills the drink and further aerates the whites. This recipe is from Honey's in NYC. You can also use Amaretto instead of Amaro for an even more complex drink!

    steps:
    - Shake lime juice, mezcal, amaro, agave, and egg white in a cocktail shaker (or in a tightly lidded 1-qt. glass jar) until frothy, about 1 minute.
    - Fill shaker with ice, cover, and shake again until outside is frosty, about 30 seconds.
    - Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a coupe glass. 
    - Garnish with a few drops of Angostura bitters (drag a toothpick through drops to create a swirly pattern if you wish). Top with lime twist.
