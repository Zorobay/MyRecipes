  steps:
  - Butter a <b>bundt mould</b> (see image).
  - Whisk flour and salt in a bowl. Set aside. 
  - Meanwhile, heat 2 tbsp butter, all the milk and almost 1 dl water in a saucepan until warm (enough for yeast, not too hot. You should be able to put your finger in it).
  - Pour the contents of the saucepan into a bowl. Mix in ½ dl sugar and crumble in the yeast. Leave to stand for 10 minutes.
  - Whisk the flour and salt mixture into the yeast with a hooked whisk. Leave to warm and swell for an hour with cling film over the bowl.
  - Mix the remaining 2.5 dl sugar in a bowl or bag with cinnamon.
  - Melt the remaining 180 g of butter in a pan and whisk in the brown sugar.
  - Heat the oven to 180 C°. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured baking surface until it is about 2.5 cm thick. Cut into pieces the size of golf balls. Mix the pieces in the sugar/cinnamon mixture and place them in the bundt mould. If the sugar doesn't stick to the pieces, pour a little over each layer in the mould. Finally, pour over the butter mixture and bake in the centre of the oven for about 35 minutes.
