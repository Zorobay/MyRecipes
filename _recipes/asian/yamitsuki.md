  steps:
  - Grind <strong>4 garlic cloves</strong>, <strong>2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil</strong>, <strong>2 tablespoons roasted white sesame seeds</strong>, <strong>1 tablespoon sake</strong>, <strong>1 teaspoon chicken or mushroom bouillon powder</strong>, <strong>1 teaspoon brown sugar</strong>, <strong>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</strong>, and <strong>1 dash MSG</strong> together using a mortar and pestle, until you achieve a smooth, aromatic paste. Go ahead, give it a taste, and adjust as needed.
  - Combine <strong>3/4 to 1 pound chopped green or purple cabbage (or a mix)</strong> and your freshly-ground seasoning paste in a large mixing bowl. Using your hands, rub the mixture into the cabbage, ensuring each piece is well coated. Alternatively, add the cabbage and the paste mixture into a sealable storage bag or container. Seal it tight and shake until the cabbage is thoroughly coated.
  - Garnish the cabbage with your choice of optional toppings. I recommend starting with <strong>extra sesame seeds</strong> and a drizzle of <strong>toasted sesame oil</strong>. For a pop of color and a spicy kick, add <strong>chili threads</strong> or <strong>chopped dried red chiles</strong>, or both.
