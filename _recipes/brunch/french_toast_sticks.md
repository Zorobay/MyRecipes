title: Cinnamon French Toast Sticks
description: Cinnamon French Toast, but in a finger licking awesome format!
ingredients:
- title:
  steps:
  - 4 thick slices white bread, preferably stale (see note)
  - 2 eggs
  - 1/4 cup milk
  - Salt
  - 1/3 cup white sugar
  - 1 tsp cinnamon powder
  - 3 tbsp butter
  - Maple syrup to serve
instructions:
- title:
  steps:
  - Remove crust of each slice, then cut each into 3 equal thick batons.
  - Combine the eggs, milk and a pinch of salt in a bowl large enough to roll the bread sticks in.
  - Combine the cinnamon and sugar on a plate.
  - Melt 2 tbsp of the butter in a large pan over medium high heat.
  - Roll the sticks in the egg mixture quickly (do not soak them), shake off excess and place in pan. Cook in 2 batches.
  - Turn to cook each side until golden.
  - Immediately transfer to the plate with the cinnamon sugar and roll to coat. It's important to do this quickly while they are hot straight out of the pan so it sticks.
  - Melt remaining butter and cook the remaining french toast sticks.
  - Serve immediately with maple syrup to dunk the sticks in.
note: Cut the slices thick enough so when you cut the crusts off then cut into 3 batons, the slices are thick, square batons about 1.7 cm / 2/3" thick. French toast is best made using stale bread. Fresh bread soaks up too much egg mixture, making it soggy on the inside and your sticks will flop when you pick them up.
